Setup and Data Acquisition:
Objective: Establish the fundamental groundwork and get the raw data.

Set up the development environment, dependencies, and required libraries.
Initialize logging.
Develop the data acquisition function (acquire_data).
Implement custom exceptions related to data acquisition.
Implement the configuration loading mechanism (load_config).
Data Preprocessing:
Objective: Prepare the raw data for analysis.

Develop data cleaning methods.
Normalize the light curves.
Detrend the data.
Implement error handling specific to data processing (DataProcessingError).
Transit Search and Validation:
Objective: Identify potential exoplanets and validate them.

Develop the transit search algorithm (search_for_transits).
Implement the validation tools and function (validate_candidates).
Account for potential feedback loops, refining the search if necessary.
Extraction, Cataloging, and Analysis:
Objective: Extract the properties of the discovered exoplanets and catalog them.

Develop parameter extraction tools and function (extract_parameters).
Implement the database interaction methods (database_tools).
Develop the cataloging function (catalog_planets).
Initiate further detailed analysis of discovered exoplanets (further_analysis).
Community Engagement and Final Touches:
Objective: Share findings and finalize the application.

Develop mechanisms to share or publish data (engage_community).
Test the entire process end-to-end.
Refine logging to ensure that it's comprehensive and intuitive.
Implement unit tests for each module and function (using pytest or a similar testing framework).
Document the code, including any configurations, dependencies, and usage instructions.
